                     I graduated from college in 2018 with a plan. I had excelled at Stony Brook University studying journalism and I was confident I’d have an engaging and challenging job secured in no time. After all, I already had secured a competitive internship for the summer and would have plenty of time to land my first full-time position.
                  </br>
                  </br>
                     I wasn’t worried. 
                  </br>
                  </br>   
                     A few days after that photo above was taken, I moved to State College, PA to start working at AccuWeather as a video producer. It took a few weeks to settle, but I was soon applying to every position that caught my eye. The weeks started to roll by, and I barely got any call backs. By the end of July, I was no closer to a job than when I first moved and stuck with the question: what am I going to do next?
                  </br>
                  </br> 
                     I recall talking with my brother and he suggested going on some kind of a trip. At first, I rejected the idea: “Go where?” I thought. But then it started to grow on me. I also had and extra $2,000 from a scholarship I had won in my last semester of college. Typically, these awards just deduct from your overall university balance, but since I had graduated, it became mine to do with what I wanted. 
                  </br>
                  </br>
                     I strung together a list of cities, found places to stay (either AirBnB or with friends) and everything seemed possible and within budget. I said, “Why not? When is the next time I’ll be able to spend a few months just driving around the country?”

                  What better place to start a trip than New York City right? I was familiar with the city, having gone in occasionally while I was just a few hours away on Long Island. This time, I chose to stay on the far Upper West Side (we’re talking streets in the 150s/160s). This was my first time really seeing Hamilton and Washington Heights and they remain as some of my favorite places in the city. Of course, I bounced around a lot… down to Brooklyn and then to Battery Park to visit with a friend from college. 
                  </br>
                  </br>
                  After three days, I was ready to get going to my next stop. New York is nice to visit but I could never live there. It takes far too long to get anywhere in that massive city. I don’t know about you, but I’m not really up for spending an hour each way just to get between boroughs. And don’t even get me started on the traffic….

                     Ah yes. Philadelphia. The city of cream cheese… I mean brotherly love.
                     </br>
                     </br>
                     I didn’t quite know what to expect when I first arrived here (the incredibly narrow streets were certainly a shock) There’s something about this city that’s just captivating. Maybe I have a soft spot since it’s kind of a sister city to St. Louis. I appreciate their similar sense of city pride.
                     </br>
                     </br>  
                     There’s a way people carry themselves here on the streets, in the parks, in restaurants and bars that exudes this quiet confidence. It’s almost like they’re saying, “We know Philly isn’t New York. And it isn’t meant to be.” 
                     </br>
                     </br>
                     If you forced me to live in one Northeastern city, I’d choose Philadelphia. You have good food, good sports… and you’re a quick train ride away from New York or DC the political and financial hubs of the country.

                     Up next: Baltimore and the nation’s capital!
                     </br>
                     </br>
                     These were pretty quick stops, only a couple of nights each and I didn’t really get that much time to explore or get a deep feel for either city, especially Baltimore. I had a friend from high school living there who I met up with, and we walked around a little through the neighborhood and park where he lived but I just didn’t know what, if anything I wanted to see. 
                     </br>
                     </br>
                     Baltimore is strange to me. I know it’s a rich and vibrant place, but the way it that other nearby cities passed it by leaves a lot of that richness undiscovered. I knew I wouldn’t hit on it in just a few days.
                     </br>
                     </br>
                     D.C. on the other hand is much easier to do in a limited timeframe. I remember my main goal was to get good Ethiopian food because I remember a fantastic restaurant from when I visited in 5th grade. Other stops included the Newseum (where the photo above is taken actually) and visiting with more friends.
                     </br>
                     </br>
                     But I left a few days later wanting more. I was searching for the same feeling I had in Philadelphia, but neither of these places captured my mind and heart in the same way.
