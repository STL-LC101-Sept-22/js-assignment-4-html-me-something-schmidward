                     I graduated from college in 2018 with a plan. I had excelled at Stony Brook University studying journalism and I was confident I’d have an engaging and challenging job secured in no time. After all, I already had secured a competitive internship for the summer and would have plenty of time to land my first full-time position.

                  </br>
                     I wasn’t worried.

                     A few days after that photo above was taken, I moved to State College, PA to start working at AccuWeather as a video producer. It took a few weeks to settle, but I was soon applying to every position that caught my eye. The weeks started to roll by, and I barely got any call backs. By the end of July, I was no closer to a job than when I first moved and stuck with the question: what am I going to do next?

                     I recall talking with my brother and he suggested going on some kind of a trip. At first, I rejected the idea: “Go where?” I thought. But then it started to grow on me. I also had and extra $2,000 from a scholarship I had won in my last semester of college. Typically, these awards just deduct from your overall university balance, but since I had graduated, it became mine to do with what I wanted.

                     I strung together a list of cities, found places to stay (either AirBnB or with friends) and everything seemed possible and within budget. I said, “Why not? When is the next time I’ll be able to spend a few months just driving around the country?”
